Instructions for how to run the application(Backend):
    1. Activate the virtual environment
    2. Run the server: python manage.py runserver
    3. In Postman specific the local-url and endpoint for register(as admin or user)
    4. Then after getting the token use that token for other endpoints
       (ex: Authorization : Bearer 'token')

Challenges I faced:
    As in Backend Django Rest Framework I have good amount of real time practical knowledge so I successfully done it.
    But in Frontend I Struggled with React.js due to limited knowledge and practical knowledge so I can't able to do it.

Future Learning Commitment:
    1. Acknowledges the gap in React.js expertise.
    2. Committed to learning and excelling in frontend development.
